# Project Management Course Repository

This repository contains my assignments, notes, and deliverables for the Project Management course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

## Structure
- **assignments/** – Project deliverables for each term milestone
- **project_docs/** – Planning templates, process documentation
- **reflections/** – Weekly reflections and self-assessments
- **resources/** – References and supporting materials

## Tools Used
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Excel / Gantt charts for scheduling
- Markdown for documentation

## Version Control Practices
- Commit messages follow the format: `<verb>: <short description>`  
  Examples:  
  - `add: initial project proposal`  
  - `update: revised Gantt chart after feedback`
- Each milestone has a separate branch before merging into `main`
